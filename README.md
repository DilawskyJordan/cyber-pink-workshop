### What is a Portfolio ?

A portfolio is a personal record in which an individual's previous learning and experience is identified and demonstrated for recognition by an educational institution or employer. It differs from a resume in the sense that the information it contains is constructed with a purpose, such as a job application, and it must also present support for the individual's learning.

# Definition
### What is a web site ?
A website is a set of web pages viewable in a browser, these pages are connected by links that allow you to move from one to another. In general, we recognize a website to the comparability of the design of its pages.

### How does a website work?
The operation of the WEB is based on an exchange system called **client-server.**

#### What is a Client-Server model?
- The client is us, it's our web browser, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc.
- And the server is in fact a powerful computer that stores and hosts websites.
